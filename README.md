# AI-Powered Hand Gesture Recognition

This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using **Python, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow**.  
It enables hands-free control of various computer functions, such as media playback and presentation navigation, through intuitive hand gestures.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe
- Deep learning model (TensorFlow) for gesture classification
- Media control (play, pause, volume control, etc.)
- Visual on-screen feedback for detected gestures

## Project Structure
- `code/` → Python scripts for data collection, preprocessing, model training, and prediction
- `poster and report/` → Project poster and report

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
- Pycaw (for volume control on Windows)
